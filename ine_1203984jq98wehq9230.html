          <h2>March 2, 2019 - A Plan Emerges</h2>
          <p>
          	I come across a 'portable escape room' on /r/DIY and begin envisioning my own, where each drawer has its own puzzle and small prizes, leading to a final grand prize (I will later remove the grand prize due to budget cuts)
          	<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/awl59h/i_made_a_portable_escape_room_for_my_friends/">Escapodanno</a>

          	<br>
          	Another Reddit post gives me the inspiration for my first gift to go in the cabinet:
          	<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/avjwwj/kakuna_rattata/">Kakuna Rattata</a>
          	<img src="img/design_process/supplementary_images/kakuna.jpg" alt="kakuna rattata">
          	<br><br>
          	At this point, I envision the grand prize being a 3D Printer, and the gifts all being 3D-printed objects, some of which, like this one, I would design myself.  Sadly, this would end up on the cutting room floor.

The show was all downhill until here, and then it just wallowed in a valley of garbage until it mercifully ended.  Up to this day, there was a very strong GoT influence in these gifts.  You'll notice, that is no longer the case.

          <h2>Finally Realizing an Idea, 5 Years Later</h2>
          <p>
          	At a previous wedding, I'd included a coffee mug with the couple's engagement photos (won a free Shutterfly mug from McMonopoly, which really makes McDonald's the genesis of this entire gift).

          	Grant and I had said I should've photoshopped myself subtly into the background of those photos and seen how long it would take them to notice.

          	Here, with my Jigsaw Puzzle...puzzle... I finally accomplished just that.  Although, subtlety is not my strong suit.

          <h2>Ripping Off Etsy Products</h2>

          	Why buy an Office-themed 'Guess Who?' board game when I can go through the painstaking effort to photoshop the Office cast into cards myself?  I ended up missing golf on the wedding because I was at FedEx with just the absolute nicest employee, who fortunately happened to partake in box-making as a hobby, and walked me through the process.

          	I was solidly reaching my limit of characters I recognized when I'd filled up the board, so any attempt to balance out the characters and bring parity to the game was abandoned.

          <h2>My Favorite Part of the Cabinet</h2>
          <p>
          	Taking an idea straight from the Escapodanno, I wanted to create a UV light clue.  But a UV light clue only sounded fun if it came with a drawing in UV light.  At that point, I might as well be throwing drawings into all of the other drawers too as a misdirection.  It turns out, drawing with a UV pen is very awkward.  There's a lot of guesswork involved in remembering what you've already got drawn, mixed with the awkward fumbling of the pen and the UV light together while smoothing out the paper and avoiding smudges at all costs.

          <h2>Two Months Late = Perfectly On Time</h2>
          <p>
          	Finally brings us to the last puzzle of the escape room.  I knew this puzzle would be digital, and triggered in some way by the code provided by the UV light clue.  I had a couple ideas around this, but I wasn't sure that any of them were feasible in a short timeframe.  So, I settled on ripping off a quiz website I found, and creating a basic trivia quiz with 15-20 questions.  I'm not sure what happened, but we're up to 1300 lines of JavaScript, 1100 lines of CSS, and the only thing this site still has in common with the 'Star Trek or Nail Polish' website anymore is the fact that both use JSON arrays to store the questions.  Hence, coming in just slightly two months after the wedding.  Which, for me, I think is actually pretty punctual!

          	Kudos to you if you found the easter egg(s!?!), and shame on you if you didn't play it on max difficulty.
